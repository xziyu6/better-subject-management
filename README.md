# Better Subject Management

A mod for Victoria 3 that improves subject management, as currently this can be very time-consuming and irritating

## Features

- Reducing autonomy or annexing a subject now only increases liberty desire of other subjects with interests in the capital region of that subject (applies to flat increase and monthly increase)
- Peaceful annexation of subjects causes half the flat liberty desire increase and no monthly modifier to other subjects
- Removes the 75% limit on acceptance of peaceful subject annexation

## Compatibility

- Game version: 1.12+
- Safe to add to existing saves
• May conflict with other mods that alter the reduce autonomy action

## Localization

Localized for all languages supported by the game. But localization for languages other than English and Chinese are AI generated and haven't been revised, I welcome any corrections if there are mistakes.

## Sources
